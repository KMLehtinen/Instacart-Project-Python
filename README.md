# InstacartAnalysis
As a student of data analytics, I employed Python to uncover trends within the Instacart market. My objective was to extract insights from the data to improve marketing and sales performance at Instacart.  

# Context

# Key Questions
What are the peak order times and days?
When do customers tend to spend the most?
How can product price ranges improve marketing strategies?

How do customer demographics and behaviors vary in terms of brand loyalty, regional differences, and purchasing patterns?

# Data Source
The project leverages open-source datasets from Instacart, complemented by specially created customer datasets. These resources are integral to addressing the outlined business questions.
